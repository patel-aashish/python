    "# Understanding Design Patterns\n",
    "## What is a Design Pattern?\n",
    "- Well known solutions to recurring problems which accepted globally\n",
    "- No need to re-invent the wheel if a efficient solution already exists\n",
    "- Falicitate reuse of ideas and encourage us to use best practises\n",
    "- Characteristics\n",
    "    - Language agnostic\n",
    "    - Dynamic can be modified as per requirement\n",
    "    - Customizable hence intentionally incomplete\n",
    "\n",
    "https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/what-is-pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of design patterns\n",
    "- Creational \n",
    "- Structural \n",
    "- Behavioral\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creational\n",
    "Used to create a object in a systematic way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Different subtype of objects from same class can be created during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural \n",
    "Explains how to assemble objects and classes into a larger structure while keeping the structures flexible and efficent.\n",
    "Establish a useful relationship between objects and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Behavioral\n",
    "Defines how different objects communicate with each other to accomplish a goal. Focus is to define a protocol that is used by both to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object oriented mechanisms used\n",
    "The Creational Patterns, Polymorphism is often used. Structural Patterns take advantage of Inheritance a lot. Behavioral Patterns heavily use methods and their signatures. Interfaces are used across all these different types of design patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "## OOPs\n",
    "Design patterns heavily rely on usage of OOP. Infact design patterns might be irrelevant to languages that don't support OOPs like C.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects are entities that represent problem as well as solution constructs.\n",
    "- Classes are templates to create object to avoid recreating them. Also to group an entity/attribute and its method together\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Inheritence and Polymorphism\n",
    "### Inheritence\n",
    "- Parent child relationship between classes\n",
    "- Child class inherits attributes and methods of parent clase\n",
    "- Child class can override or add new methods/atributes of parent class\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "- Relies on inheritence\n",
    "- Allows child class to be instantiated as Parent class.\n",
    "- in other words, it allows parent class to be used/treated like any of its child class\n",
    "- User does not have to know what kind of class it is. He can just use it like a parent class. And the type is decided or revealed at runtime\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding pattern context\n",
    "To best use the design pattern it is important to understand the context in which a particular pattern works best.\n",
    "A pattern context consist of \n",
    "- Participants\n",
    "\n",
    "This are classes involved in design pattern. Each class plays different role in order to achieve the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quality attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-functional requirements such as modifiability, usability, performance etc. Related to entire software, addressed for architectural solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forces & Consequences\n",
    "Factors/Trade-offs considered while adopting a design pattern. Typically boil down to quality attributes discussed above. \n",
    "If not choosen carefully then might result in unwanted consequences later on. Like choosing a pattern for best security might impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing when to use which pattern is important as they might cause more problems instead of solving them when misused.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pattern language\n",
    "Important terms used while describing a desgin pattern.\n",
    "- Name: Gist of the pattern, should be meaningful and easy to remember\n",
    "- Context: Provide info on scenarios in which this pattern can be used. It also provide info on when not to use.\n",
    "- Problem: describes challenge this pattern is trying to address\n",
    "- Solution: Pattern itself, specified in terms of its structure(relationship between elements) and behavior(interaction between the elements)\n",
    "- Related patterns: list other patterns that can be used together with this pattern. Also patterns that are similar to this pattern, and what are differences \n",

    "A creational design pattern that lets us create complex objects with many variable parameters step by step. A separate builder class can be used to specify each step and then client can construct an object based on requirement.\n",
    "The pattern organizes object construction into a set of steps (buildWalls, buildDoor, etc.). To create an object, you execute a series of these steps on a builder object. The important part is that you don’t need to call all of the steps. You can call only those steps that are necessary for producing a particular configuration of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the Builder pattern to get rid of a “telescopic constructor”.\n",
    "\n",
    " Say you have a constructor with ten optional parameters. Calling such a beast is very inconvenient; therefore, you overload the constructor and create several shorter versions with fewer parameters. These constructors still refer to the main one, passing some default values into any omitted parameters.\n",
